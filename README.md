# command-line-trash
Ever accidentally 'rm'-ed something and then had to redo HOURS of work because it just disappeared rather than going into the trash? Well that's exactly what I did which prompted me to create this little tool.

**trash** is a simple script you can add to your path (or alias to rm for those of us too stuborn to change our habbits) that moves things into the Gnome/Budgie desktop's trash can rather than deleting them forever.

The *only* things required by you is to:
 1. Make file executable.
 2. Move file into your $PATH.

(I might make an install script that handles that bit but I'm not sure).

Enjoy!
